For now, just remember that every Java application has a class definition, 
and the name of the class should match the filename in Java.
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }

This is the main method. Every application in Java must contain the main method. 
The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method.

How does it work? Good question. However, we will not discuss it in this article. After all, 
it's a basic program to introduce Java programming 
language to a newbie. We will learn the meaning of public, static, void, and how methods work? 
in later chapters.

For now, just remember that the main function is the entry point of your Java application, and 
it's mandatory in a Java program.The signature of the main method in Java is:

public static void main(String[] args) {
... .. ...
}

System.out.println("Hello, World!");
 
The code above is a print statement. It prints the text Hello, World! to standard output (your screen).
The text inside the quotation marks is called String in Java.

Notice the print statement is inside the main function, which is inside the class definition.



**************Things to take away*********************


Every valid Java Application must have a class definition that matches the filename 
(class name and file name should be same).
The main method must be inside the class definition.
The compiler executes the codes starting from the main function.
This is a valid Java program that does nothing.

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
    }
}
